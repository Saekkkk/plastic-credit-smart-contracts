# Blockchain-Based Plastic Credit System

This repository contains the smart contract implementations and pseudocode supporting the paper:

**"Blockchain-Enabled Plastic Credit Systems: A Pathway to Achieving SDGs in Indonesia"**  
*(Submitted to Waste Management, Elsevier, 2024)*

## 📦 Contents
- **TokenMintingContract.sol**  
  ERC-20 smart contract for minting PLST tokens based on validated plastic recovery reports.
- **NFTCertificationContract.sol**  
  ERC-721 smart contract for issuing NFT certificates upon PLST token retirement.
- **Algorithm_A.1_TokenMinting.txt**  
  Pseudocode for token minting process.
- **Algorithm_A.2_NFTCertification.txt**  
  Pseudocode for NFT certification process.

## 📝 Description
This project demonstrates how blockchain technology (ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards) enables traceable, tamper-resistant plastic credit systems without reliance on centralized oversight. The smart contracts automate plastic credit issuance, burning, and NFT certification, supporting transparency and ESG reporting.
