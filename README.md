Smart contracts for blockchain-based plastic credit system (ERC-20 &amp; ERC-721 implementation)

# Blockchain-Based Plastic Credit System

This repository contains the smart contract implementations

**"How Can a Plastic Credit System Improve Traceability and Verifiability in Plastic Waste Management?"**  

## 📦 Contents
- **TokenMintingContract.sol**  
  ERC-20 smart contract for minting PLST tokens based on validated plastic recovery reports.
- **NFTCertificationContract.sol**  
  ERC-721 smart contract for issuing NFT certificates upon PLST token retirement.

## 📝 Description
This project demonstrates how blockchain technology (ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards) enables traceable, tamper-resistant plastic credit systems without reliance on centralized oversight. The smart contracts automate plastic credit issuance, burning, and NFT certification, supporting transparency and ESG reporting.
